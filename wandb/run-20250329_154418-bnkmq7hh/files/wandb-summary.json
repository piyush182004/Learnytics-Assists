{"study_hours":"12","syllabus_content":"## Science for Dyslexic Children\n\n**Age:** 2\n\n**Difficulty:** Good\n\n**Study Hours:** 12\n\n**Objectives:**\n\n* Identify the basic shapes of objects.\n* Describe the properties of objects.\n* Sort objects based on their properties.\n* Learn to read simple words.\n\n**Materials:**\n\n* Colorful objects of different shapes (e.g., circles, squares, triangles, cubes, cylinders, cones)\n* Books with simple stories and illustrations\n* Sorting containers\n* Colorful crayons or pencils\n* Pictures of objects\n\n**Activities:**\n\n**Day 1:**\n\n* Introduce the concept of shapes.\n* Use props to demonstrate the different shapes (circle, square, triangle).\n* Play a matching game with the objects.\n\n**Day 2:**\n\n* Introduce the concept of properties.\n* Use simple objects to demonstrate different properties (e.g., flat, round, big, small).\n* Sort the objects based on their properties (e.g., all the circles, all the squares).\n\n**Day 3:**\n\n* Introduce the concept of sorting.\n* Use sorting containers and pictures of objects to teach how to sort things by size, shape, or color.\n* Read simple stories together and point out different properties of the objects.\n\n**Day 4:**\n\n* Introduce the concept of reading simple words.\n* Use picture cards with simple words and point out the pictures.\n* Read simple stories together and point out the names of the objects.\n\n**Assessment:**\n\n* Observe the child as they participate in the activities.\n* Ask questions to check their understanding.\n* Have the child draw a picture of their favorite object.\n* Read a simple story together and have the child point out the objects in the pictures.\n\n**Differentiation:**\n\n* For struggling readers, provide a picture card with a word written out.\n* For struggling learners, use simpler objects and provide more guided instructions.\n* For advanced learners, challenge them to identify more complex shapes and properties.\n\n**Extension Activities:**\n\n* Make a poster that shows the different shapes.\n* Create a collage of objects that demonstrate different properties.\n* Read a children's book about science.\n* Visit a museum or nature center.","_timestamp":1.7432432681105666e+09,"_wandb":{"runtime":9},"execution_time":9.397751569747925,"age":"2","difficulty":"good as a child","additional_notes":"make a science syllabus","_runtime":9.9119184,"_step":0}
